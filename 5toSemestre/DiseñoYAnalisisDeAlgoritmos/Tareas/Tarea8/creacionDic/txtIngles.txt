It may be that the task I have set myself of writing a complete history of the Roman people from the very beginning of their existence will reward me for the labor invested in it, I do not know for certain, nor do I think I can venture it. For I see that this is a common and anciently established practice, every new writer is always persuaded that they will neither attain greater certainty in the matters of their narrative, nor surpass the rudeness of antiquity in the excellence of their style. Even if this be so, it will still be a great satisfaction to me to have had my share also in investigating, to the utmost of my abilities, the annals of the most important nation in the world, with a deeper interest; and if in such a body of writers my own reputation proves obscured, I console myself with the fame and greatness of those who eclipse my fame. The subject, moreover, is one that demands immense labor. It goes back more than years and, after a modest and humble beginning, has grown to such a magnitude that it is beginning to be overwhelming in its grandeur. I have no doubt, either, that for most of my readers the early days, and those immediately following, have little appeal; they will hasten to these modern times when the might of a major nation is worn down by internal decay. I, on the other hand, shall seek a greater reward for my labors in being able to close my eyes to the evils which our generation has witnessed for so many years; as long, at least, as I am devoting my whole thought to reproducing the clear records, free from all the anxiety which may disturb the historian of his time, though they may not warp him of the truth.
